    <h1>HK Bus ETA Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have <strong>not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Anonymous analytics data may be collected</strong> for the purpose of improving the app, for example, identifying which function is particularly popular.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only data stored locally on your device are bus route caches, which can be <strong>simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>GPS information</strong> used (such as to find nearby bus routes and stops from your location) is <strong>only used at the moment and is not stored or collected</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTTPS Requests are made to the above data sources to retrieve bus routes, stops, and ETA information. <strong>No personally identifiable information</strong> (apart from information essentially needed to perform a request, such as the IP address) is sent in such requests.
    </p>
